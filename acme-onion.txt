1.  Introduction

   While onion addresses are in form of DNS address, they aren't in part
   of ICANN hierarchy, and onion name's self-verifying construction
   warrents different verification, duce different identfier type for
   them is worth consider.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14,
   [RFC2119].

3.  Onion Identifier

   [RFC8555] only defines the identifier type "dns", but it assumes it's
   on public CA/B hirearuchy

   An identifier for the onion address
   acmeulkebl5k66q4sgcgzpe3tddrffnpn5gpnkpamz4zcuv5hk7fqwad.onion would
   be formatted like:

{"type": "onion-v3", "value": "acmeulkebl5k66q4sgcgzpe3tddrffnpn5gpnkpamz4zcuv5hk7fqwad.onion"}

4.  Validation Challenges for onion address

   Onion-v3 identifiers MAY be used with the existing "http-01" and
   "tls-alpn-01" challenges from [RFC8555] Section 8.3 and [RFC8737]
   Section 3 respectively.  To use Onion identifiers with these
   challenges their initial DNS resolution step MUST be skipped and the
   approperate Tor daemon that in control of CA MUST used to proxy such
   request.

   The exsisting "dns-01" challange MUST NOT be used to validate onion
   addresses.

   In addition to challanges earlier RFC defined, there

4.1.  CSR signed with Onion public key challagne

   With Onion-csr validation, the client in an ACME transaction proves
   its control of oninon address by proving the possesion of onion
   hidden service identity key.  The ACME server challenges the client
   to sign CSR that includes the nonce it gave with.

   The Onion-csr ACME challenge object has the following format:

   type (required, string):  The string "onion-v3-csr

   token (required, string):  A random value that uniquely identifies
      the challenge.  This value MUST have at least 128 bits of entropy.
      It MUST NOT contain any characters outside the base64url alphabet
      as described in [RFC4648] Section 5.  Trailing '=' padding
      characters MUST be stripped.  See [RFC4086] for additional
      information on randomness requirements.

   The client prepares for validation by constructing a self-signed CSR
   that MUST contain an cabf caSigningNonce Attribute and a
   subjectAlternativeName extension [RFC5280].  The
   subjectAlternativeName extension MUST contain a single dNSName entry
   where the value is the domain name being validated.  The cabf
   caSigningNonce Attribute MUST contain the token string as ascii
   encoded for the challenge.

   The cabf caSigningNonce Attribute is identified by the cabf-
   caSigningNonce object identifier (OID) in the cabf arc [RFC5280].
   conseurt [cabr] appendex B for how to construct CSR itself in detail.

   A client fulfills this challenge by construct the challange CSR from
   the "token" value provided in the challange, then POST on challange
   URL with crafted CSR as payload to request validated by the server.

   POST /acme/authz/1234/1
   Host: example.com
   Content-Type: application/jose+json

   {
     "protected": base64url({
       "alg": "ES256",
       "kid": "https://example.com/acme/acct/1",
       "nonce": "XaYcb5XoTUgRWbTWw_NwkcP",
       "url": "https://example.com/acme/authz/1234/1"
     }),
     "payload": base64url({
          "csr": "MIIBBzCBugIBADAAMCo...gRYTMAhRP8nIH",
        }),
     "signature": "0wSzBJBgNVHREEQ...gYJKoZIhvcNAQkOM"
   }

   On receiving this request from client, the server verifies client's
   control over the onion address by verifiy that CSR is crafted with
   expected properties:

   1.  CSR is signed with private part of identity key the requested
       onion address made from.

   2.  A caSigningNonce attribute that contains token Value that
       challenge object provided.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Identifier Types

   Adds a new type to the Identifier list defined in Section 9.7.7 of
   [RFC8555] with the label "onion-v3" and reference I-D.ietf-acme-
   onion.

5.2.  Challenge Types

   in the Validation Methods list defined in Section 9.7.8 of [RFC8555]:

   Adds the raw "onin-challange-csr" to the Validation Methods.

   Adds the value "onion-v3-csr" to the Identifier Type column for the
   "http-01", "onion-challange-csr", and "tls-alpn-01" challenges.

6.  Security Considerations

   As onion addresses are able to generated in massive quantity without
   financial cost, it bypasses the normal ratelimit CAs imposess.  CAs
   SHOULD adapt some mesure to prevent DoSing the CA by create hugh
   amount of request for onion address.  For exemple, imposing limit per
   ACME account or require order to have at least one non-onion domain.
