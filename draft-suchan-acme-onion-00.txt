1.  Introduction

   While onion addresses [RFC7686] are in form of DNS address, they
   aren't in part of ICANN hierarchy, and onion name's self-verifying
   construction warrants different verification, duce different
   identifier type for them is worth consider.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Onion Identifier

   [RFC8555] only defines the identifier type "dns", that assumes it's
   on public CA/B hierarchy, so to make clear Onion addresses are not
   using normal DNS verification methods, we assign a new identifier
   type for onion v3 addresses, "onion-v3".

   This document only handles V3 version of onion address as defined in
   [Toraddr], identified by 56 letters base domain name ends with d.

   This document doesn't handle about verification of version 2 of onion
   addresses, as they are retired already

   An identifier for the onion address
   aeceulkebl5...4zcuv5hk7fqwad.onion would be formatted like:

   {"type": "onion-v3", "value": "aeceulkebl5...4zcuv5hk7fqwad.onion"}

   Keep mind in CSR this address still treated as DNS.

4.  Validation Challenges for Onion address

   Onion-v3 identifiers MAY be used with the existing "http-01" and
   "tls-alpn-01" challenges from [RFC8555] Section 8.3 and [RFC8737]
   Section 3 respectively.  To use Onion identifiers with these
   challenges their initial DNS resolution step MUST be skipped and the
   approperate Tor daemon that in control of CA MUST used to proxy such
   request.

   The existing "dns-01" challenge MUST NOT be used to validate onion
   addresses.

   In addition to challenges earlier RFC defined, This document create
   an additional challenge called "onion-v3-csr".  This challenge can be
   used for wildcard subdomain of Onion address.

4.1.  Identify Key Possession Challenge

   With onion-csr-01 validation, the client in an ACME transaction
   proves its control of an Onion address or subdomain of it by proving
   the possession of Onion hidden service's identity key.  The ACME
   server challenges the client to sign CSR that includes the nonce it
   gave as challenge.

   The onion-csr-01 ACME challenge object has the following format:

   type (required, string):  The string "onion-v3-csr"

   token (required, string):  A random value that uniquely identifies
      the challenge.  This value MUST have at least 128 bits of entropy.
      It MUST NOT contain any characters outside the base64url alphabet
      as described in [RFC4648] Section 5.  Trailing '=' padding
      characters MUST be stripped.  See [RFC4086] for additional
      information on randomness requirements.

   The client prepares for validation by constructing a self-signed CSR
   that MUST contain an cabf caSigningNonce Attribute and a
   subjectAlternativeName extension [RFC5280].  The
   subjectAlternativeName extension MUST contain a single dNSName entry
   where the value is the domain name being validated.  The cabf
   caSigningNonce Attribute MUST contain the token string as ascii
   encoded for the challenge.

   The cabf caSigningNonce Attribute is identified by the cabf-
   caSigningNonce object identifier (OID) in the cabf arc [RFC5280].
   consult [cabr] appendix B for how to construct CSR itself in detail.

   cabf OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= 2.23.140
   {
     joint-iso-itu-t(2)
       internationalorganizations(23)
         a-browser-forum(140)
   }

   caSigningNonce ATTRIBUTE ::= {
   WITH SYNTAX OCTET STRING

   ID { cabf-caSigningNonce }
   }

   EQUALITY MATCHING RULE octetStringMatch
   SINGLE VALUE TRUE
   ID { cabf-applicantSigningNonce }
   }
   cabf-applicantSigningNonce OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { cabf 42 }

   A client fulfills this challenge by construct the challenge CSR from
   the "token" value provided in the challenge, then POST on challenge
   URL with crafted CSR as payload to request validated by the server.

   POST /acme/authz/1234/1
   Host: example.com
   Content-Type: application/jose+json

   {
     "protected": base64url({
       "alg": "ES256",
       "kid": "https://example.com/acme/acct/1",
       "nonce": "XaYcb5XoTUgRWbTWw_NwkcP",
       "url": "https://example.com/acme/authz/1234/1"
     }),
     "payload": base64url({
          "csr": "MIIBBzCBugIBADAAMCo...gRYTMAhRP8nIH",
        }),
     "signature": "0wSzBJBgNVHREEQ...gYJKoZIhvcNAQkOM"
   }

   On receiving this request from client, the server verifies client's
   control over the onion address by verify that CSR is crafted with
   expected properties:

   1.  CSR is signed with private part of identity key the requested
       onion address made from.

   2.  A caSigningNonce attribute that contains token Value that
       challenge object provided.

   3.  existence of applicantSigningNonce attribute.  This value SHOULD
       include random value from client side with at least 64bits of
       entropy, and CA MUST recommend to client do so, but servers are
       not expected verify such claim, as by nature it's impossible to
       verify such claim of randomness.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Identifier Types

   Adds a new type to the Identifier list defined in Section 9.7.7 of
   [RFC8555] with the label "onion-v3" and reference I-D.ietf-acme-
   onion.

5.2.  Challenge Types

   in the Validation Methods list defined in Section 9.7.8 of [RFC8555]:

   Adds the raw "onion-v3-csr" to the Validation Methods.

   Adds the value "onion-v3" to the Identifier Type column for the
   "http-01", "onion-challenge-csr", and "tls-alpn-01" challenges.

6.  Security Considerations

   As onion addresses are able to generated in massive quantity without
   financial cost, it bypasses the normal ratelimit CAs imposes.  CAs
   SHOULD adapt some measure to prevent DoS of CA by create hugh amount
   of request for onion address.  For example, imposing limit per ACME
   account or require order to have at least one non-onion domain.

Appendix A.  Notes and Questions to reviews

   should this be about onion address, or all kind of alternative DNS
   systems? should identifier type and challenge type include or strip
   -v3 tag from its name? if we include that how about this doc name
   itself? http-01 and tls-alpn-01 over tor will work as well for like
   onion address V2 or V12, but csr challenge may not. but it's
   reasonable to ask same identifier type should give same set of
   challenges. should the as rigid as complying this will make comply
   CA/B Baseline requirement? while type onion domain name just full
